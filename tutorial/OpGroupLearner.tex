\section{Learning schemes}

Acquiring knowledge is fundamental for the development of intelligent
systems. The operators described in this section were designed to
automatically discover hypotheses to be used for future
decisions. They can learn models from the given data and apply them to
new data to predict a label for each observation in an unpredicted
example set. The \op{ModelApplier} can be used to apply these models
to unlabelled data.

Additionally to some learning schemes and meta learning schemes directly
implemented in \rapidminer, all learning operators provided by Weka are also
available as \rapidminer learning operators.
