\section{Input/Output operators}

The operators described in this section deal with input and output of
all kinds of results and in-between results. Models, example sets,
attribute sets and parameter sets can be read from and written to
disc. Hence, it is possible to split up process into, for
instance, a training process setup and a evaluation or application
process setup.
