\chapter{Notes}

This document contains the description of all operators of \rapidminer as
they can be used within proprietary products after purchasing a license from Rapid-I. 
However, please note the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item The operators that are derived from the Weka machine learning
  library are \emph{not} part of the proprietary version of \rapidminer. If
  you want to use those operators, you have to chose one of the native
  \rapidminer learners instead. Please ask for guidance if it not clear to
  which operators this apply.
\item The functionality of the described operators is guaranteed according to
  the publicly available JUnit tests which are part of the \rapidminer CVS.
\end{itemize}
